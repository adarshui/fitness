# Fitness App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for building a fitness app that will provide users with tools to track their fitness journey. The app will include user authentication (registration and login), a personalized home dashboard, user profile management, activity tracking, and workout logging. The core functionality will be built using React, with Firebase providing backend services for authentication and data storage.

## Detailed Project Outline

The project will be developed iteratively, adding features step-by-step.

### Core Features
 
*   **User Authentication:**
    *   User Registration
    *   User Login
*   **Navigation:**
    *   Routing between different pages
*   **User Pages:**
    *   Home Page (Dashboard)
    *   User Profile Page
    *   Activity Tracking Page
    *   Workout Logging Page
*   **Data Management:**
    *   Store User Profiles (age, weight, height, goals)
    *   Store Activity Data (type, duration, distance, calories)
    *   Store Workout Logs (exercises, sets, reps, weight)
    *   Retrieve and display user data
*   **User Interaction & Suggestions:**
    *   Handle user input in forms
    *   Develop logic to provide suggestions based on user input and fitness goals.
    *   Provide suggestions based on user input (to be refined)
*   **Progress Visualization:**
    *   Display charts and graphs of user progress
*   **UI/UX:**
 *   Visually appealing and consistent user interface
 *   Mobile responsiveness

### Backend (Django with SQLite)
*   Django will be used as the backend framework.
*   SQLite will be used as the database.
*   Firebase Authentication will be used *only* for user registration and login.
*   All other data (user profiles, activities, workouts, etc.) will be managed by Django models and stored in SQLite.
*   We will define necessary Django models and create API endpoints to interact with the frontend.

### Frontend (React)
*   React for building the user interface.
*   `react-router-dom` for routing.
*   Potential use of a component library (Material-UI or Chakra UI) for UI components.

## Plan for Current Iteration: Basic Structure and Authentication

This iteration focuses on setting up the foundational structure of the application, including user authentication and basic navigation.


### Steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Install `react-router-dom` and the necessary Firebase SDKs (`firebase`). Consider installing a component library like `@mui/material` or `@chakra-ui/react` at this stage.
2.  **Configure Firebase:** Initialize Firebase in the project and set up Authentication and either Firestore or Realtime Database in the Firebase console. Create a Firebase configuration file in the project.
3.  **Create Page Components:**
    *   Create `src/pages/Register.jsx` with a basic form structure for registration inputs (email, password, etc.).
    *   Create `src/pages/Login.jsx` with a basic form structure for login inputs (email, password).
    *   Create `src/pages/Home.jsx` with a simple placeholder for the home page content.
4.  **Configure Routing:** In `src/App.jsx`, set up `react-router-dom` to handle routing between the Register, Login, and Home pages.
5.  **Implement Basic Navigation:** Add simple links or buttons on the Register and Login pages to navigate between them.
6.  **Implement Firebase Authentication (Basic):** Add basic logic in `Register.jsx` and `Login.jsx` to handle user registration and login using Firebase Authentication. This will include handling form submissions and interacting with the Firebase SDK.
7.  **Test Authentication:** Verify that users can register and log in successfully.
8.  **Enhance Styling:** Improve the visual appearance and mobile responsiveness of the registration, login, and home pages using CSS. Aim for an attractive design based on the visual design guidelines, potentially using CSS Modules for component-specific styles.
9.  **Refine UI:** Make initial adjustments to the UI of the basic pages to align with the desired look and feel.
10. **Set up Protected Routes:** In `src/App.jsx`, implement logic to protect routes that should only be accessible to authenticated users (e.g., the Home page) using Firebase Authentication's state.
11. **Implement Firebase Authentication in Register.jsx:** Add the necessary Firebase Authentication code to handle user registration when the registration form is submitted.
12. **Implement Firebase Authentication in Login.jsx:** Add the necessary Firebase Authentication code to handle user login when the login form is submitted.
